\abstract{Literature involving preferences of artificial agents or human beings often assume their preferences are linear, that is, the preference can be represented using a complete transitive antisymmetric binary relation. Much has been written however on more complex, or more interesting, models of preferences. In this article we review some of the reasons that have been put forward to justify more complex modeling, and review some of the techniques that have been proposed to obtain models of such preferences. (Optional: we connect to various related literature about argumentation, …)}

\section{Introduction}
Here are possible subjects we might want to talk about.
\begin{itemize}
	\item reasons for rebel preferences: non transitivity; may be linear according to some other description (Sen)
	\item reasons for modeling rebel preferences (VS simpler approx): use the resulting undeterminacy (lability)
	\item descriptive VS prescriptive; preferences are complete or transitive
	\item why ranking ≠ choice ≠ sorting
	\item maximizing does not require transitivity
	\item nec and possible
	\item class of models by generality
	\item axiomatics
	\item computational difficulties
	\item argu : expliquer le modèle ; éliciter le modèle ; choix classe de fonctions
\end{itemize}
